I'm a software engineer from Argentina with 10+ years of experience, a lot of passion and dedication for what I do. I've been programming since 2009, working with a variety of language, most of them, self-taught, and always trying new technologies and solutions.

I love to be challenged and to learn by doing. I'm always trying to learn new languages and improve my code. I believe in clean code, well documented and easy to read.

For the past 4 years, I found a passion in baking sourdough bread. You will find a couple of recipes and bread posted here or at [Olaf Bakery](https://www.instagram.com/olafbakery/). Feel free to take a look and please give them a try and start baking :)

Don't hesitate in contacting me to talk about anything you want.
